A software engineer with 2 years of experience. Currently studying MSc in Computer Science at the MIU. It is my 3rd MSc in the 3rd continent. The US is the 7th country I have been living in for a long period.

Obsessed with chickens and I am working on eggs, co-author of the "High accuracy gender determination using the egg shape index" paper.

For me, engineering is all about perspective and traveling is such a "builder" for it.
